## Limitations
- When crouching in dog mode, dropped items can fall through the ship
- When holding certain items in dog mode (dog ragdoll in particular), they may partially or fully obstruct your view
- Masked enemies using the dog model that were not spawned from a possession do not have masks
- Masked enemies spawned from a dog model will not have a mask if [Mirage](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/qwbarch/Mirage/) is being used, regardless of config
- Some animations look a little funky for masked enemies using the dog model
- Blood spatter does not apply to dog players or their ragdolls
